# Troubleshooting log

Problems hit during the build, their causes, and the fixes. Error strings are
verbatim so they are searchable. The phase walkthroughs describe the path that
worked; everything that went wrong lives here.

| Phase | File | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | [00-infrastructure.md](00-infrastructure.md) | Terraform ordering races, and a region with no v1 B-series |
| 1 | [01-ad-environment.md](01-ad-environment.md) | Three bugs in our own scripts, two sharing a root cause: trusting state read before a change instead of re-reading after it |
| 2 | [02-entra-connect.md](02-entra-connect.md) | A Windows Server default, a correct refusal, and one thing still unexplained |
| 3 | [03-branch-network.md](03-branch-network.md) | Three regions, three different reasons a region can be unusable |
| 4 | [04-hybrid-join.md](04-hybrid-join.md) | A missing module path, and a sync that reported success while syncing nothing new |
| 5 | [05-group-policy.md](05-group-policy.md) | Four machines and two accounts sharing a name, and a file copy that reported success while copying half |
| 6 | [06-security-baselines.md](06-security-baselines.md) | A baseline that blocked the tool sent to measure it, and a measurement done another way |
| 7 | [07-windows-laps.md](07-windows-laps.md) | Two refusals about who you are, and a correct policy ruined by one character |
| 8 | [08-tiered-administration.md](08-tiered-administration.md) | A preference that stayed after the policy was corrected, a tickbox that locked every domain account out, and a dropdown that read Enabled while switched off |

## Recurring themes

**A guard that fails closed looks identical to success.** The preflight that
wrongly reported "already a domain controller" and the `-EnableUsers` switch that
silently did nothing both produced confident, wrong output rather than an error.

**A setting can report as configured while doing nothing.** Phase 8 hit this three
times. A LAPS policy read `Enabled` in both the dialog and the GPO report while its
dropdown sat on `Disabled`. A Group Policy Preference reported success against a group
name that resolved to nothing. An empty `$domainDN` in a new PowerShell session built a
distinguished name of `OU=Servers,` and the error blamed the OU. In each case the layer
that reports state and the layer that holds the value are different, and only the second
one matters.

**A partial check of a multi-part operation passes while the operation is broken.**
The Phase 1 guard that tested only whether an object existed, and the Phase 5
template count that proved 214 files had copied while every language file was
missing, are the same mistake at two different layers.

**Scripts that both change and verify must re-read in between.** Two separate
Phase 1 bugs came from filtering a collection fetched before the change.

**The error names the symptom, not the cause.** The Group Policy Client hang named
`gpsvc` when the cause was `SysvolReady = 0`. The Entra sign-in blamed JavaScript
when the cause was Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

**Terraform orders what it can see.** Three separate Phase 0 failures came from two
operations with no dependency edge between them running concurrently.
