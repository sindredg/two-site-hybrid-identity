# Risk and limitations

What this lab does not do safely, and what would have to change if it stopped
being a single-operator prototype.

---

## 1. State

| Issue | Impact | Fix outside a prototype |
|---|---|---|
| Local backend | No locking. Two concurrent applies would corrupt state | `azurerm` backend with blob lease locking |
| No versioning | A bad write is unrecoverable beyond `terraform.tfstate.backup` | Storage account with blob versioning and soft delete |
| Single copy | Losing the machine orphans every billed Azure resource with no way to `destroy` them | Remote state, or at minimum an off-machine copy |
| File mode `0644` | World-readable on a multi-user system | `chmod 600` as the minimum |
| **Two state files now** | Phase 3 added `terraform/azure-denmarkeast/branch/`. Every issue above applies twice, to two files that must both survive | Same fix, applied to both roots |

The local backend is documented as suitable for solo prototypes only, which this
is. The gap is real regardless, and splitting the lab into two roots doubled the
surface without changing the nature of it.

---

## 2. The admin password is in state, in plaintext

`azurerm_windows_virtual_machine.admin_password` is written to
`terraform.tfstate` unencrypted. `sensitive = true` masks CLI display and does
nothing to storage.

Two consequences:

- **Anyone who can read state can read the credential.** State readers are secret
  readers. This is why the file must never be committed
- **The password is ForceNew.** A mismatch plans a destroy and recreate of both
  VMs, including a promoted domain controller. If a plan shows
  `azurerm_windows_virtual_machine` as `-/+ must be replaced`, stop

`terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfvars` are covered by the repository
`.gitignore` in every root. Verify with `git check-ignore -v` before any first
commit to a new clone.

**The same password is now in two state files**, since the branch machines join the
same domain and need the same local administrator credential. Either file leaking
is equivalent to both.

**Checked, and not fixable in the provider.** azurerm 4.81 offers no write-only
variant of `admin_password`, confirmed against the provider schema. Terraform 1.11
introduced write-only arguments precisely for this, but the resource does not
implement one, so this cannot be solved in the configuration.

---

## 3. One password across every VM, closed in Phase 8

The same local administrator credential was used on every machine, and became the
Domain Admin password after promotion. Exactly the flat-credential pattern that
endpoint hardening exists to argue against.

**Phase 7 closed half of it.** Windows LAPS now gives each managed endpoint its own
random rotating password, encrypted at rest and readable only by `sg-it-admins`:

| Machine | Local administrator | State |
|---|---|---|
| CL01 | Managed by LAPS, encrypted, in Active Directory | Fixed |
| CL02 | Managed by LAPS, in Entra ID | Fixed |
| CS01 | Managed by LAPS, encrypted, in Active Directory | Fixed in Phase 8 |
| DC01 | No local accounts exist; promotion migrated them into the directory | Not applicable |

**CS01 was structural, not an oversight.** Its computer object sat in `CN=Computers`
because it joined the domain in Phase 1 before the OU structure existed, and a GPO
cannot be linked to a container. Phase 8 moved it to `OU=Servers` and applied the same
LAPS pattern. The password in `terraform.tfstate` no longer opens any machine in the
lab.

**The domain half is now split.** `Domain Admins` holds `t0-admin` and `labadmin`.
`labadmin` has a new password, stored outside the repository and outside Terraform, and
is retired to break-glass use. Deny-logon rights stop any tier account reaching a
machine outside its own tier.

The encryption principal does bind even Domain Admins: reading CL01's password as
`labadmin` returns `DecryptionStatus: Unauthorized`. Forest administration does not
confer decryption, which is a stronger boundary than a directory ACL alone.

**Closed in Phase 8.** Two things remain accepted rather than fixed, and are recorded
below as separate entries: `labadmin` is deliberately exempt from every deny rule so
that a recovery path exists, and `sg-it-admins` now holds a single account while being
the encryption principal for two machines' LAPS passwords.

---

## 4. CI checks syntax, nothing reviews intent

`.github/workflows/terraform.yml` runs on every push and pull request:

| Check | Scope |
|---|---|
| `terraform fmt -check -recursive` | Repo root, so both roots and the shared module |
| `terraform validate` | Each root separately, as a matrix |

That catches formatting drift, syntax errors, bad references and type mismatches
before they land. It is a real gate and it did not exist before.

**What it still does not do.** No `plan`, so nothing reviews what a change would
actually do to live infrastructure. No policy check. No second pair of eyes on an
apply.

**The missing `plan` is a deliberate trade.** Running one in CI needs Azure
credentials stored as repository secrets. For a lab whose state already holds a
plaintext administrator password, adding cloud credentials to GitHub buys a marginal
review gain for a real increase in blast radius. Every apply is therefore local,
manual, and reviewed only by whoever is reading the terminal.

Outside a prototype the answer is a service principal scoped to one subscription,
OIDC federation rather than a stored secret, and `plan` posted to the pull request
for review before a gated apply.

---

## 5. The provider lock file, checked and not a problem

**This entry was wrong and is kept as a correction rather than deleted.**

It previously claimed `.terraform.lock.hcl` recorded hashes for `linux_arm64` only,
and that a clone on any other OS would fail `init` with a checksum error.

Both lock files hold one `h1:` hash and **twelve `zh:` hashes**. Those two kinds are
not the same thing:

| Hash | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `h1:` | A directory hash of the extracted package, for the one platform installed locally |
| `zh:` | The registry-signed zip hash, one per platform the provider publishes |

Twelve `zh:` entries means every published platform can be verified on download, so
a clone on Windows or amd64 Linux initialises normally.

Confirmed rather than assumed. Running the fix the old entry recommended:

```bash
terraform providers lock -platform=linux_arm64 -platform=linux_amd64 -platform=windows_amd64
```

reported `Terraform has validated the lock file and found no need for changes` in
both roots, which is Terraform stating directly that nothing was missing.

**Where the original advice does apply.** A lock file built from a local filesystem
mirror carries `h1:` hashes only, with no `zh:` entries, and then the platform
problem is real. Built from the public registry, as these were, coverage is
automatic.

The CI added in entry 4 now proves this on every push: the runner is `linux_amd64`
and initialises from these lock files without complaint.

---

## 6. Security posture of the lab tenant

Security defaults were disabled in this tenant during an earlier project to
unblock Azure CLI authentication. An identity lab whose own tenant runs without
MFA undercuts the exercise.

**Intended fix:** replacing security defaults with an equivalent Conditional Access
policy needs P1 and is not reachable here. The remaining options are to re-enable
security defaults and accept the MFA prompt on the Azure CLI, or to leave them off
and say so, which is what this entry does. Tracked as open.

---

## 7. Default outbound access, on two subnets now

With the public IPs removed, the VMs reach the internet through Azure's implicit
outbound access. That address is Azure-owned, can change, and Microsoft is moving new
virtual networks to private-by-default.

Confirmed on both subnets rather than assumed:

```bash
az network vnet subnet show --resource-group rg-branch-office --vnet-name vnet-branch --name snet-branch
```

`defaultOutboundAccess: true` on `snet-lab` and on `snet-branch`. The branch subnet
was worth checking specifically, because it was created after Microsoft began
withdrawing the default, and it was ruled out as a cause during the Phase 4 device
registration failure.

If either network is rebuilt, outbound may need an explicit NAT Gateway. Windows
Update, the Security Compliance Toolkit download, hybrid join device registration and
activation all depend on it, so the failure would be broad rather than subtle.

## 8. The Seamless SSO key needs rotating every 30 days, by hand

Enabling Seamless SSO in Phase 2 created a computer account, `AZUREADSSOACC`, in
the forest. Microsoft is blunt about what its Kerberos decryption key is:

> The Kerberos decryption key on a computer account, if leaked, can be used to
> generate Kerberos tickets for any synchronized user. Malicious actors can then
> impersonate Microsoft Entra sign-ins for compromised users.

That is a skeleton key for every synced identity. It should be rolled **at least
every 30 days**, and nothing does it for you:

```powershell
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect\AzureADSSO.psd1'
New-AzureADSSOAuthenticationContext
$creds = Get-Credential
Update-AzureADSSOForest -OnPremCredentials $creds
```

Run it more than once per forest in a session and Seamless SSO breaks until
existing tickets expire.

**Two related obligations:**

The account should use **AES256**, not `RC4_HMAC_MD5`. The July 2026 Windows
Server update changes the default Kerberos encryption type in AD DS from RC4 to
AES-256, and an account still on RC4 when that lands can stop working. The key
must be rolled *before* changing encryption type, not after.

The account itself should be protected: manageable only by Domain Admins, Kerberos
delegation disabled on it, and parked in an OU where it will not be deleted by
accident.

**Why this stays open.** A manual 30-day rotation with no expiry warning and no
enforcement lapses silently. Seamless SSO was enabled for demonstration value and
because it gives Phase 5 a real Group Policy task, not because this lab needs it. If
the rotation is not going to happen, the options are to accept the risk explicitly or
disable the feature.

**The Group Policy half is now delivered.** Phase 5's `User-Standard` carries the
Site to Zone Assignment List entry that lets a browser send its Kerberos ticket to
the Entra endpoint, which is what makes Seamless SSO function rather than merely
exist. The key rotation above stays open and unautomated.

---

## 9. AD Recycle Bin, enabled in Phase 5

**Closed.** Flagged by the Entra Connect wizard on its completion page. Without it,
a deleted user, group or OU was recoverable only from a system state backup, and
this lab has no backup at all.

```powershell
Enable-ADOptionalFeature 'Recycle Bin Feature' -Scope ForestOrConfigurationSet -Target sindredg.local
```

**It is irreversible**, which is why it is off by default. For a lab where every
object was created by a script that could recreate it, the case is weaker than in
production. It was enabled because Phase 7 would extend the schema and the proposed
Phase 8 would restructure OUs, and an accidental deletion during either would
otherwise be unrecoverable.

**Phase 7 has since run**, adding six attributes and an extended right to the schema.
That change is itself irreversible and independent of the Recycle Bin, which protects
deleted objects rather than schema modifications.

Evidence and the confirmation prompt are in
[05-group-policy.md](05-group-policy.md).

---

## 10. The Azure control plane is an unreduced path to Tier 0

Phase 8 builds a tiered administration model inside Active Directory. It does not
constrain the layer underneath it.

```bash
az vm run-command invoke -g rg-hybridid-swedencentral -n DC01 --command-id RunPowerShellScript --scripts "whoami"
```

That returns `nt authority\system`. The request goes to Azure Resource Manager, which
hands the script to the VM agent already running inside Windows. No logon takes place,
so no User Rights Assignment applies. Anyone holding `Virtual Machine Contributor` on
the subscription can run SYSTEM code on a domain controller and therefore owns the
forest, without ever authenticating to Active Directory.

This is not theoretical. It was used twice during Phase 8, once to recover CS01 after
every domain account was locked out of it.

**Why it is not removed.** It is the only recovery path when the management machine is
the broken one. Removing it would leave no way back from a mistake in the deny rules.

**What would reduce it in a real environment:** separate subscriptions for Tier 0
assets, Privileged Identity Management on the Azure roles so `Virtual Machine
Contributor` is not standing access, and deny assignments on the domain controller
resource. All three need licensing this tenant does not have.

**Attribution differs too.** Work done through `run-command` appears in the Windows
logs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with no user attached. The only record of who did it is
in the Azure Activity Log, on the other side of the boundary.

---

## 11. `sg-it-admins` holds one account and decrypts two machines

After Phase 8 removed `cdubois`, `sg-it-admins` contains only `t1-admin`. That group is
the encryption principal for CL01's and CS01's LAPS passwords. If `t1-admin` is lost,
those passwords cannot be decrypted by anyone, including Domain Admins, which returns
`DecryptionStatus: Unauthorized`.

**It is recoverable.** Encryption is to the group SID, not to the account, so adding any
member to `sg-it-admins` restores decryption of existing passwords. A second account in
the group would remove the single point of failure entirely, and was not added because
the lab has no second person.

---

## 12. `labadmin` is exempt from every deny rule

The tier model denies cross-tier logon for `sg-tier0-admins`, `sg-it-admins` and
`sg-helpdesk`. `labadmin` belongs to none of them, so it reaches every machine in the
lab.

That is deliberate. It is RID 500, cannot be deleted, cannot be locked out by policy,
and is the account that still works when Kerberos, DNS or a Group Policy change have
broken everything else. A tier model with no exempt account has no recovery path.

The cost is that a single credential still exists which, if stolen, defeats the whole
model. What reduces that in practice is that it is no longer used for routine work, its
password exists in one offline place, and any use of it is by definition an incident.
None of that is enforced by the lab, so it stays an open risk rather than a closed one.
